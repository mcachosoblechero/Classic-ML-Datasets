# Classic ML Datasets
Best way of sharpening ML techniques is going back to the basics. This repo does exactly that. 
The following datasets have been explored:
- **Titanic Dataset**: The one and only, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- **MNIST Dataset**: We will use the MNIST dataset to explore CNN architectures, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
